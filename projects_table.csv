Instacart Exploratory Data Analysis,"In this e-commerce grocery project, I analyzed Instacart’s public transaction dataset to uncover shopping-behavior insights that can guide marketing and inventory strategy. Using Python (pandas, NumPy) in Jupyter, I cleaned data quality issues, then visualized order volume by hour, day-of-week, and days-since-prior purchase, as well as product and aisle popularity with Matplotlib. Key findings showed peak ordering at 10 AM, a weekly reorder cadence (median = 7 days), and heavy preference for organic produce—insights that help optimize promotion timing and stock levels.","Python, pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, Jupyter, exploratory-data-analysis, visualization, customer-behavior, grocery, e-commerce, transaction-data, Instacart, retail",https://github.com/IMMontoya/Instacart_EDA/blob/main/README.md
Telecom Plan Revenue Statistical Data Analysis,"In this telecom revenue study for Megaline, I analyzed a 500-subscriber dataset to determine which prepaid plan—Surf or Ultimate—yields greater monthly revenue and whether users in the NY-NJ market differ from other regions.
