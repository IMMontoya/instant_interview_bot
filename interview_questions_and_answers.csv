questions,answers
Tell me about yourself,"Over the last three years I have been steadily transitioning into a career in tech, specifically focusing on data related roles. This transition began when I was working as a Billing and Accounts Manager for a local Art transportation and installation company. While working with financial data in this role I discovered an interest in analytics and programming, solving several business problems by implementing new technologies. 

    From there I transitioned into a Data Specialist role at StrataTech Education group where I performed regular and ad hoc analysis for the Marketing, Finance, and Admissions departments. Additionally I gained experience working with SQL databases, ETL procedures, and writing automated scripts for data ingestion. During this time I also began utilizing online training sources to learn to program in Python. My commitment to continuous learning and aptitude for solving business problems resulted in consistently receiving ""exceeds expectations"" in my semi-annual performance reviews. 

    Most recently, I have completed a 700 hour data science certification program. During this time, I reinforced my working experience in data analysis and programming, as well as gained significant experience in data science, source control, command line interfaces, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. I am very comfortable querying SQL databases, programming in Python, and using advanced methods in Excel, such as VBA scripting. This wide range of skillsets makes me a good fit for large, highly structured companies, as well as smaller companies looking to improve how they do business."
Tell me about your experience as a data specialist,"I was responsible for a wide range of tasks a data specialist. My responsibilities included:
    
    - Monitoring/troubleshooting data pipelines for marketing efforts. For example, we contracted a call center to help contact leads that our internal reps could not get to. While auditing this process I discovered the automation was sending the leads we had already contacted instead of ones we had not. This error was costing the company thousands of dollars on a monthly basis.
    - Managing and reporting all data related to the Marketing Department, including KPI's for marketing goals and financial data. About 4,000 leads a month, and over 1 million dollars in spend per month.
    - Developed dashboards for realtime data tracking, using tools such as Salesforce Intelligence, PowerBi, and SQL.
    - Ad hoc data analysis, answering questions, and presentations. If something wasn't right, or didn't seem right, with the data, I was the go to person. I often improved process, or provided valuable insights to leadership of the Marketing, Finance, Admissions, and IT teams."
Describe your top three technical skills. Which skills would you like to improve next?,"I think my three best skills are creative problem solving, computational thinking, and data manipulation. At StrataTech I solved the major problem of monthly budgeting process taking way too long and being very error prone by creating an Excel workbook that automated this process while checking for errors in account number assignments. Building this workbook with formulas and VBA scripts also required some good computational thinking in order to make it a repeatable process month to month and year to year. Likewise, this required data manipulation skills since a major function of the workbook was a process that gathered all the spend information into a concise report for purchase orders to be sent to the accounting department.
    
    Moving forward I would like to improve my machine learning skills by applying them within a business setting. My exposure to data analysis was rooted in real-world experience first, then formal education. As such, the difference between theory and practice has always been very apparent to me. I'm eager to see how this applies to machine learning."
Why are you interested in Data sphere?,"My working experience has proved to me that working in data is a very good fit for me. I am very analytical and process minded. I am also relentless when it comes to problem solving and improving efficiency, which this line of work creates a great outlet for. I also love learning new skills and applying them, which aligns well the industry's constant evolving nature. I am also incredibly excited and interested in the breakthroughs that are happening in artificial intelligence. Long term I would really like to be working with these systems to solve some of our biggest problems and make huge impacts on our quality of life."
How would you define success in your career?,"I would define success as first becoming an integral and trusted part of the organization I join, proving myself as an agile learner with unique skills and perspectives to offer. Advancement, particularly within the same organization, is very important to me as well. I plan on continuing to learn new technologies and would like to see my role and responsibilities evolve alongside my continued education."
Can you tell me about a challenge or conflict you faced at work and how you managed to solve it?,"Yes. A particularly difficult challenge I faced occurred early on when I was working for Art Solutions, I had accidentally charged a customer 3500 instead of 350. Luckily I caught the error the same day, before the customer noticed. I knew I had to rectify the error right away and call the customer to inform them and apologize. The first step I took was to inform my supervisor then present a plan of action: to void the transaction, that way I could call the customer having already solved the problem. I then called and apologized for the mistake and let them know what they could expect to see on their charges. The customer was a little annoyed early on, but in the end thanked me solving the issue right away and calling to apologize."
What communication challenges could you face while working in a remote team? How would you overcome them?,"Working remotely for StrataTech I saw how easy it was for communications to get lost in the shuffle of emails, instant messages, meetings, etc and how that led to misunderstandings of priority. I wore a lot of hats there and had to field and prioritize a lot of requests from several different departments. My solution to this was to keep a dynamic list of tasks ordered by their priority, from time to time I would check in with my supervisor to see if I was prioritizing tasks the way they expected. This really helped keep us on the same page and eliminate surprises."
Describe a problem that you had to solve but lacked important information. What did you do?,"I recently wrapped up a data science internship with a language learning app company. The platform is just over a year old and even the owner has some knowledge gabs in how all the data is structured. I was tasked with analyzing customer journey and retention, but some ambiguities in the data structure proved to be problematic without a clear answer from the owner. Since the owner could not definitely answer some of my questions about the data, I developed questions and analysis to answer those questions. For example: ""what is the difference between 'subscription_end' and 'subscription_cancel'? Can a subscription end without a cancel?"" By taking this approach, I was able to validate some assumptions about the data set while flagging other inconsistencies to the owner. This resulted in reliable analysis and detailed documentation regarding the data structure for future analysis."
Can you guide me through one of the projects you are most proud of? Why are you proud of it? What business problem did it solve?,"As the Data Specialist at StrataTech, it was my responsibility to prepare a monthly spreadsheet so the marketing team could plan their spending against the allotted budget. The main challenges were
    1. Costs needed to be split between hundreds of general ledger accounts.
    2. A spreadsheet passed around by several people resulted in a lot of typos, errors, and miscalculated formulas.
    All of this made the process excruciatingly slow and error prone. So I committed to building a tool that would eliminate these errors and make the process more efficient. I did this by creating a an xlm file that utilized macros and protected cells in a way that allowed users to input the dynamic data, but prevented making changes to static values like GL account numbers.  This was achieved with table schemas and Xlookups. The project was a huge success and cut the entire process time down by at least half. The tool I built is still in use today, even after they have added new campuses and GL accounts. Which speaks to the robustness of its design."
What is your working process when you start a new project?,"I like to start projects from a bird's eye view. What do I have to work with, and what am I trying to achieve? I try to ask as many practical questions as I can before diving into the technical. Once I feel confident in the expectations for the project, I like to build a general outline of the steps I will need to accomplish and estimate the time it will take to achieve each. This helps me catch any roadblocks I may encounter earlier on, and if need be I can prioritize those. Then I dive into the technical. For data projects this is where I would begin the EDA process. After this I take a more iterative approach, being sure to adjust my initial plan in accordance with new discoveries and continuing to update my expectations for time needed to complete the subtasks I have outlined."
Can you tell me about a situation where your analysis of a problem was deemed to be incorrect? What would you have done differently?,"At StrataTech we had two important metrics for measuring our reps performance: speed to contact and speed to enroll. I put together a report to show average times for each of these metrics. For each lead, contact always happens before enrollment, so many stakeholders expected to see a longer speed to enroll vs speed to contact. However, since not all leads convert to enrolls, the data for average speed to enroll was a smaller subset of the full dataset, which lead to a shorter speed to enroll vs speed to contact. This raised a lot of confusion.
    
    What I wish I had done differently is prepared for that issue to be raised and had an explanation of the subsets ready to present. I also would have prepared a different version with NaN values for speed to lead replaced with a ceiling number (from start to data pull date). This was a solution I liked because it told a fuller story and was in line with stakeholder expectations."
When was the last time you had to come up with a new idea for your colleagues or manager? How did you convince them to consider it?,"A portion of my responsibilities at StrataTech was to allocate spending to unique general ledger accounts. These accounts defined several variables: campus-program-channel and almost followed a recognizable pattern. One campus, for whatever reason, had several channels grouped into one ledger. This obfuscated the details of our financial reporting on several occasions. So I proposed to my manager that we work with the finance department to fix that inconsistency. What convinced them is that I was able define exactly what we needed and how to achieve it when I first proposed the change. By gathering all the information and understanding the logic of the system, I was able to propose a solution as opposed to raising an issue."
Give me an example of an important result you delivered in your work. How did you present it to different audiences (colleagues/supervisor/client)?,"At StrataTech we underwent a data migration process that had major implications for how all of marketing reporting was done. I was tasked with helping the IT team understand the Marketing department's needs for the new system and how to get there. This required a lot of communication between departments. So I was tasked with communicating business goals to IT team, and technical details to the Marketing team. I handled this by considering what each department needed. For Marketing that meant staying big picture and communicating what had been solved and what roadblocks we were running into. When speaking with the IT team, I was detailed in the expectations the Marketing team had and provided documentation."
Tell about a time you saw the need for change and took the initiative.,"When I first started working at Art Solutions, customer storage changes were tracked on a whiteboard in the middle of the office. Often times people would not updated the board (because it was far from their desk), or accidentally erase something that shouldn't have been. It also meant that to log the changes in our system, I would have to copy the whiteboard onto a piece of paper and then take that back to my desk for calculating monthly storage costs. So I proposed that we start using a shared google doc sheet that way everyone had equal access, and we could track changes using the version history. This made a big improvement in how we recorded information and the general workflow."
Describe a time when you thought outside the box to tackle some job-related problem.,"One of the most time consuming tasks I inherited at StrataTech was manually creating monthly purchase orders for each of our vendors. Each purchase order had the same structure and only needed a few dynamic variables filled in depending on the vendor. So I leveraged Microsoft Power Automate to build an automation that could transform the monthly POs document I received from accounting into individual purchase order documents. Once completed, this turned a monthly 16 hour task into just a few clicks."
How do you ensure that you have high self-motivation on a daily basis?,I really lean on to-do lists. Starting the day with a detailed plan and a list of goals to achieve  really helps me get in the zone and stay on track. I prefer to end my days by planning for the next (building tomorrow's to-do list). I really like this because I can leave work knowing I have plan for tomorrow and set everything aside until I clock back in. This really helps with work life balance too.
What goals in your career development have you already achieved?,"Two major goals I have achieved are:
    
    1. Getting my foot in the door with a data related job. This was great because it gave me the direct exposure I was looking for to test if that type of role would be a good fit for me. That exposure sparked the last two years of up-skilling I have been doing.
    2. Becoming a proficient Python programmer with a strong understanding of machine learning and AI concepts. I distinctly remember reading an article in 2019 about the advancements in AI and how Python was the go-to language for all that work. At the time I thought I had missed my chance to learn these technologies, but just a few years later I am ready to make it a part of my career."
Describe a recent case where you had to cope with working super fast.,"I recently completed a coding challenge where I and a team of two other people only had 4 days to build a machine learning model capable of predicting genres. My role on the team was specifically to gather the data set from the Spotify API, so I had to quickly learn a new system and deliver a quality data set that could be used for machine learning training. I was able to do this by breaking the problem down into smaller steps first, and devising test cases to understand those smaller steps before trying to work with massive data pulls. I had specific questions I knew I needed answered before I could attempt the full scale project. As I investigated those questions I updated my questions and expectations for the approach. Taking the time at the front end to understand the full process saved a lot of time since I wasn’t experimenting while make large, time consuming API calls. Ultimately I was able to put together a very robust and well thought out data set that resulted in strong predictive model."
What can become a difficulty for you when you work in a team?,"I think the most difficult thing is effective communication and a clear understanding of expectations. Personally, I’m sort of type A. I really like a structured environment and strict definitions. On the flip side, I struggle when working in ambiguous environments. I  try to mitigate this by reviewing action items at the end of team meetings, as well as cadence of tasks if one depends on the other."
Share a situation when you achieved greater results a) as a team; b) as a solo player,"A situation where I received great results as part of a team would be my participation in a team coding challenge. Tasked with building a predictive model end to end (from data retrieval from the Spotify API to a working predictive function), our team decided to clearly define our roles. I excitedly took on the role of Data Engineer, focusing my efforts on retrieving the necessary data from the Spotify API and collecting into a csv file. Being able to focus on a narrow scope allowed to me to build a strong data pipeline in a short timeframe.
    
    On the other hand, I have produced a lot of great results as a solo player. I was able to build powerful automations at StrataTech because I understood the processes end to end. These projects were more time consuming, and generally more challenging, but resulted in meaningful impacts to the business's day to day."
What are your salary expectations?,"I am looking to make at least 75K. I have a over ten years of working experience and more than three years experience working with data and programming. I have also made a significant investment in my education, completing a 700-hour data science certification, a data science internship, and several other certifications in Python programming and data analysis to complement my bachelor's degree from Arizona State University. I am a strong believer in leaving things better than I found them, and this is evident in my work history. I am confident that I can bring a lot of value to your team and am excited about the opportunity to do so."
Do you have any questions for me?,"Some questions I might ask are:
    - How do you define success for this role? What does that look like after 30, 60, 90 days?
    - How did this position open? Is it related to restructuring, growth, or attrition?
    - What does a typical work day or work week look like for this role, what technologies would I work with the most?
    - What is the typical career path for someone starting in this position?
    - Do you have any advice for candidates applying to this role in terms of highlighting their most relevant qualifications and experience during the interview process?"
When can you start?, "I am ready to start as soon as you are! I have spent the last year really focusing on up-skilling and I am eager to start making an impact."
What is your expected salary?, "I believe a $75,000 salary is appropriate the level of experience and professionalism I have to offer."
any experience with R, "While I don't have direct experience with R, I'm a skilled data analyst with a strong foundation in programming languages, particularly Python. My expertise in Python, combined with my experience working with various data analysis tools and technologies, such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and SQL, enables me to quickly adapt to new languages and tools.

As a data analyst, I'm confident in my ability to learn and apply new skills, including R, if required. My understanding of data analysis principles, statistical concepts, and data visualization techniques is language-agnostic, and I'm able to apply these skills to a variety of tools and technologies.

If a project or task required the use of R, I would be able to rapidly learn the language and apply my existing knowledge of data analysis and statistical concepts to deliver high-quality results. My ability to learn quickly, combined with my strong analytical skills and experience working with large datasets, makes me a versatile and valuable asset to any team."
How would you handle a dispute with a coworker?, "When handling a dispute with a coworker, my approach would be to remain calm, professional, and respectful. First, I would try to understand the root cause of the issue and listen to my coworker's perspective, asking clarifying questions to ensure I grasp their point of view. It's essential to create a safe and open environment where both parties feel heard and valued.

Next, I would express my own thoughts and concerns, focusing on the specific issue at hand, rather than making personal attacks or assumptions. I believe it's crucial to separate the problem from the person and avoid taking things personally. By doing so, we can work together to find a solution that benefits the team and the organization as a whole.

If the dispute is related to a work-related issue, I would try to find a mutually beneficial solution that aligns with our team's goals and objectives. I would also be open to compromise and finding a middle ground that works for both parties. If necessary, I would suggest involving a supervisor or mediator to help facilitate the discussion and provide guidance.

Throughout the process, I would maintain a positive and respectful tone, avoiding defensiveness or aggression. My goal would be to resolve the dispute in a way that strengthens our working relationship and improves our team's overall performance. By addressing conflicts in a constructive and respectful manner, we can build trust, foster collaboration, and create a more positive and productive work environment."
