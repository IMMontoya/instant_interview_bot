While I\u2019m proud of many of the projects I\u2019ve worked on, I believe my biggest accomplishment was developing a custom function in Python to transform 19 GB of JSON event data into a relational data model during my internship at Kippy AI. \n\nThis was a significant challenge because the data was initially unstructured and difficult to query efficiently. I designed and implemented a Python script that parsed the JSON data, extracted relevant information, and organized it into a relational format suitable for analysis. This transformation unlocked valuable insights into customer data, including common countries of use, learning languages, subscription behaviors, and conversion rates. \n\nBeyond the technical achievement, this project had a direct impact on the business. The insights I uncovered helped the company better understand its customer base and optimize its marketing strategies. I then presented these findings to the business owner in a thorough slide-deck presentation with informative visualizations. This experience solidified my ability to not only perform complex data manipulation but also to communicate technical findings effectively to non-technical audiences. It really demonstrated my ability to take a problem from start to finish and deliver tangible results."", ""options"": null}]",3,Dislike,2025-03-28 12:32:25.535369
